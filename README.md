This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems. I started this project to track my progress and improve my coding skills.

### `Table of Contents`
<li>
<ul>Solutions</ul>
<ul>Notes</ul>
<ul>Resources</ul>
</li>
### `Motivation`
I have always been interested in improving my coding skills and solving LeetCode problems seemed like a great way to do so. By committing to solving at least one problem every day, I hope to improve my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.

### `Instructions`
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and navigate to the solutions directory. Each subdirectory in solutions corresponds to a specific problem and contains the code for my solution. The notes directory contains any additional notes or explanations I wrote while solving the problems. The resources directory contains helpful resources that I found during my LeetCode journey.

### `Contributing`
If you find an error in my code or have a more optimal solution, feel free to open a pull request. I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve my code or my approach to problem-solving.
